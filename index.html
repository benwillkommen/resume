					<h2>Lead Web Architect - jockey.com</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">September 2014 - Present</p>
					<p>I lead the development team for jockey.com. Technical responsibilities run the gamut from front end development such as implementing a responsive single page checkout with AngularJS, to more back end and process improvement projects such as implementing a simple CMS using git and .NET MVC extensibility points, to DevOps flavored projects like leveraging Vagrant for development environments to speed up on boarding.</p>

					<p>I work closely with project managers to define and refine our development process, find the balance between agility and stability, and improve communication with stakeholders.</p>

					<p>I mentor both the development and design teams, facilitating the growth of their technical skills and sharing my passion for code with the goal of creating a fun, engaging developer culture.</p>
