            <h2>Senior Software Engineer - Optimizely</h2>
            <p class="subDetails">September 2019 - August 2020</p>
            <p>I was an Optimizely customer and fan before I was an employee, and am excited to build a product
              that helps engineering, product, and design teams ship faster, and make better decisions.</p>

            <p>My personal mission is to help bridge the gap between architectural aspirations,
              and implementation reality; to deliver the infrastructure and
              tech debt payments that accelerate our engineering organization internally, while simultaneously
              building the next generation of experimentation and progressive delivery platforms.</p>

            <p class="subDetails">August 2018 - September 2019</p>

            <p>I worked with several engineering teams in a consulting capacity to help accelerate their work, vet
              implementation options, identify inter-team dependencies, and establish consenus on best practices.</p>

            <p>I collaborated with product teams to create a technology roadmap, ensuring that how we build products
              puts
              engineering in a strategic position for success.</p>

            <p>I was also the technical product owner for the platform engineering team, whose mission is to implement
              the technology roadmap.</p>

            <p>As an individual contributor, I developed proof of concepts to show our teams what it will take to build
              cloud native applications and push more of our application to edge computing.</p>

            <h2>Lead Developer - Charles Schwab</h2>
            <p class="subDetails">July 2016 - December 2017</p>
            <p>I was the lead for a web application development team that works
              on a variety of products.</p>

            <p>In my first three months, I shipped a single page application for visualizing sales metrics backed by a
              REST
              API using Knockout and .NET Web API.</p>

            <p>This project also served as an educational catalyst for the team. I created presentations for the
              development
              team on dependency injection, testing, and modern javascript build pipelines based on the code for the
              project,
              as well as implemented and dogfooded an Agile development process, including our team's first use of JIRA.
